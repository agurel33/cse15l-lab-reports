# Week 2 Lab Report
## Introduction

* This lab report is a tutorial on how to log into a course-specific account on UCSD's `ieng6`. 
* Through using a terminal, you can remotely access the CSE lab computers at UCSD and run commands to compile, run, and edit files and folders.

## 1. Installing VScode

* First, we are going to download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to access our files, folders, and terminal through it.
* After installing, when you open up VSCode, you should see a screen similar to below.

## 2. Remotely Connecting 

* If you are on Windows, you will first need to install a program called 
[OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) 
to be able to connect to other computers with OpenSSH.
* You will then have to find your personal course-specific account for CSE15L through
[Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
* You will then open a terminal in VSCode(Ctrl/Command + `) and input 
```
$ ssh cs15lwi22acl@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
* (It is one, five, l(not one))
* Once you press enter, since it is the first time you are connected to this server, you will receive this message:
```
â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi22acl@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
* This message is expected when connecting to a new server for the first time,so just type yes and press enter.
* It will then ask you for your password, which you will type in and and press enter, and you will see a message like this in your terminal:<br>

* If you see a similar message, that means you have successfully logged in.

## 3. Trying Some Commands

* Once you are logged in, now it is time to run some commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `cp`, both on the remote computer through `ssh` and on your personal computer.
* More useful commands you can try are: 
1. `cd ~`
2. `ls -lat`
3. `ls -a`
4. `ls <directory>` where your `<directory>` is `/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi22abc` and `abc` is another person's username
5. `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi22/public/hello.txt ~/`
6. `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi22/public/hello.txt`
* As seen below, you may not have permission to access certain directories or files using above commands

* To log out of the remote server, you can use either Ctrl + D, or run the `exit` command.

## 4. Moving Files with `scp`
* The next step in working remotely is being able to move files back and forth between your personal computer and the remote computer or server that you connect to.
* The command to copy a file from your computer to the server is called `scp` and you will always run it from your client terminal (from your computer, not logged into `ieng6`).
* Set up a sample file on your computer called `WhereAmI.java` and past the following into it:
```
class WhereAmI {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
  }
}
```
* Running this command on your own computer, using `javac` and `java`, will show you the file location on your computer.
* On your computer terminal, run the command(using your personal username):
```
scp WhereAmI.java cs15lwi22acl@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/
```
* You will be prompted for a password, and afterward when you log in with `ssh`, when you use `ls` you should see your file in your home directory.
* As seen in the two screenshots below, compiling and running WhereAmI.java gives me a location on my personal computer and also a location through the ssh.
**Personal:** <br>

**Through SSH:** <br>

* If you see something similar, you have successfully moved files onto the `ssh` directory using `scp`!

## 5. Setting an SSH Key

* Through using SSH keys, you can use `ssh` and `scp` with the remote server without having to input your password.
* `ssh-keygen` creates a pair of keys, or files, called the public key and the private key. When the public key is copied onto a specific spot on the server while the private key is present on the client, the `ssh` command will use the pair of files to grant you access instead of requiring you to input your password.

* Set it up on your client (personal computer) like this:

```
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:jZaZH6fI8E2I1D35hnvGeBePQ4ELOf2Ge+G0XknoXp0 joe@Joes-Mac-mini.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|                 |
|       . . + .   |
|      . . B o .  |
|     . . B * +.. |
|      o S = *.B. |
|       = = O.*.*+|
|        + * *.BE+|
|           +.+.o |
|             ..  |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

* However, if you are doing this process on Windows, you have to do an extra `ssh-add` step by clicking 
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation).
* This process creates two new files `id_rsa` (private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (public key).
* Now, you need to copy the public key (ending in .pub) to the .ssh directory on your account on the server.

```
$ ssh cs15lwi22acl@ieng6.ucsd.edu
<Enter Password>
$ mkdir .ssh
$ <logout>
$ scp /Users/arda/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cs15lwi22acl@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

* After doing this, you should now be able to use `scp` and `ssh` without having to use your password, as seen below.

## 6. Optimizing Remote Running

To optimize remote running, you can use the following tips:
* Write a command in quotes at the end of your `ssh` command in order to run it on the remote server and exit afterwards:

```
$ ssh cs15lwi22acl@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls"
```

* You can also use semicolons in order to run multiple commands on the same line:

```
$ cp WhereAmI.java OtherMain.java; javac OtherMain.java; java WhereAmI
```

* To quickly recall the last command run, you can also use the up-arrow on your keyboard.
* You can also use the `history` command in the terminal, as seen in the screenshot below:
