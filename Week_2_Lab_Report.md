6. Optimizing Remote Running
## 1. Installing VScode
* First, we are going to download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to access our files, folders, and terminal through it.
* After installing, when you open up VSCode, you should see a screen similar to below.

## 2. Remotely Connecting 
* If you are on Windows, you will first need to install a program called 
[OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) 
to be able to connect to other computers with OpenSSH.
* You will then have to find your personal course-specific account for CSE15L through
[Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
* You will then open a terminal in VSCode(Ctrl/Command + `) and input 
```
$ ssh cs15lwi22acl@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
* (It is one, five, l(not one))
* Once you press enter, since it is the first time you are connected to this server, you will receive this message:
```
â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi22acl@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
* This message is expected when connecting to a new server for the first time,so just type yes and press enter.
* It will then ask you for your password, which you will type in and and press enter, and you will see a message like this in your terminal:<br>

* If you see a similar message, that means you have successfully logged in.
